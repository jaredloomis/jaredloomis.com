  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, and welcome to my personal site! I'm a junior developer
    with an insatiable appetite for code, living in San Diego.
    There's not much up here now, but you can head on over to
    my <a href="https://github.com/jaredloomis">GitHub</a> to see what
    I've been working on.
