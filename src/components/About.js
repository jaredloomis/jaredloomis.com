    I am a freelance Software Engineer based in San Diego. My career
    in software began in the startup world in 2015, where I created
    internal software for a shipping logistics startup. In 2019 I transitioned to
    Amazon and built a cloud application serving
    hundreds of thousands of customers. In 2020, I transitioned to freelance work,
    and have never been happier with my career. I love working directly with clients to
    understand the job they need done and delivering a dependable solution.

    When I'm not working with clients, I'm out surfing, snowboarding, playing guitar, and seeing live music.
