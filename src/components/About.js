    I am a freelance Software Engineer based in San Diego. My career
    in software began in the startup world in 2015, where I created
    internal software for a shipping logistics startup. In 2019 I moved into
    the corporate world of Amazon and built a cloud application serving
    hundreds of thousands of customers. In 2020, I transitioned to freelance work,
    and have never been happier! I love working with clients to understand their needs and
    deliver a dependable solution.

    When I'm not working with clients, I'm out surfing, snowboarding, playing guitar, and seeing live music.
