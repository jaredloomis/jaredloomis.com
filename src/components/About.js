  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a Java & JavaScript Software Engineer with industry experience
    developing applications which increase productivity. I have a
    driven, can-do attitude arising from a passion for all things technology.
    Building things is what I truly enjoy doing - there's nothing like seeing
    the software I contributed to, solving people's daily problems, and
    enriching their lives.
